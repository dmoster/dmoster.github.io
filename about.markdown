Hi, I'm Daniel. 

I am passionate about the idea that life is about finding joy and helping others to do the same. I'm into technology because I believe that its purpose is to improve our lives.

Mostermind is my place for sharing thoughts and building technology meant to bring greater efficiency, effectiveness, and happiness to others. At the very least, it'll be my platform for writing blog posts and showcasing a few developer skills; it's my hope, though, that it will grow into a proper software startup.

Whether it's an article that teaches you something, a simple game that brings a smile to your face, or a productivity tool that enhances your workday, I hope you find something here for you.

Please feel free to send me a message if you'd like to chat!
