2020 is approaching faster than any year has before. With its advent comes the ushering in of a new decade, a whole new version of the ‘20s. 

And while I’m still in my own 20s, that will change just a few years from now. A lot has happened in the last 10 years. Even more, it seems, is likely to occur in the next 10. 

I have had this overwhelming feeling over the last several months that a great shift will soon be taking place in my life. And with the realization just a few days ago that the impending new year brings with it a new decade, an equally overwhelming feeling took hold&#8212;that of knowing that I can and should be in control of the aforementioned shift my life will be undergoing.

Coming to a head over the next couple of years will (hopefully) be my educational, career, health, and relationship goals:
* I've been marathoning school almost nonstop since 2010 and have solid plans to graduate with bachelors degree #2 in 2021. 
* I'm on the lookout for a big kid's career-type job in my field of choice (software engineering). 
* After excessive flip flopping, I am on a slow-but-steady track to finally live a more healthy lifestyle by eating better and exercising more. 
* My wife and I are absolutely loving living with our toddler and soon-to-be newborn in our small southwestern Ohio town.

I am hoping that with all of that comes some great opportunity for growth. In particular, I will be working very hard to build and maintain solid exercise and self-improvement habits over these next few years. I'm trying to come out of an activity slump at present, but I know that in the past living in a more healthy way physically did wonders for my mental health and capacity as well. 

I'm a firm believer in that adage that states,
> "If you don't take time now to be healthy, you'll certainly take time later to be sick."

So here's to a decade of fitness, of living better for the sake of living better. I'm sure that with a lot of dedication (and perhaps a little help), this will be the decade that sets me up to make the ones that follow even better.
