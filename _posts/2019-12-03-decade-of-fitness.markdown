# A Decade of Fitness

2020 is approaching faster than any year has before, at least for me. With its advent comes the ushering in of a new decade, a whole new version of the ‘20s. 

And while I’m still in my own 20s, that will change just a few years hence. A lot has happened in the last 10 years. Even more, it seems, is likely to occur in the next 10. 

I have had this overwhelming feeling over the last several months that a great shift will soon be taking place in my life. And with the realization just a few days ago that the impending new year brings with it a new decade, an equally overwhelming feeling took hold--that if knowing that I can and should be in control of the aforementioned shift my life will be undergoing.
