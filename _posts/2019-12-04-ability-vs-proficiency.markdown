I've had a battle going on in my head for the past few weeks. In that battle, I'm at odds with myself over whether or not I have true *proficiency* in programming.

You see, my *ability* to create an application is pretty substantial at this point. Using enough documentation, I could build something that looks nice and runs smoothly using various combinations of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java, PHP, Node.js, C++, Swift, and Bootstrap.
