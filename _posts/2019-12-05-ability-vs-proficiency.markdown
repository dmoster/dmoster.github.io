I've had a battle going on in my head for the past few weeks. In that battle, I'm at odds with myself over whether or not I have true *proficiency* in programming.

You see, my *ability* to create an application is pretty substantial at this point. Using enough documentation, I could build something that looks nice and runs smoothly using various combinations of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java, PHP, Node.js, C++, and Bootstrap. With those, I can build web apps, Android apps, and command line utilities.

But I can't help but wonder if I have real proficiency in them, if I would consider myself on track to become fluent in, say, JavaScript or C++? And I also can't help but wonder a few other things along the way. 

* Do most software engineers consider themselves fluent in at least one or two programming languages?
* Should I be picking one or two to specialize in?
* How much from-memory proficiency is required in a developer technical interview?

I have read that it's generally a good rule-of-thumb to have a passable knowledge in many things and then pick one or two languages to really dive deep into. And that makes sense; you want to be able to at least *join* the conversation with most of the team, as well as *lead* in some aspect or another. You want to be a significant contributor in your company, someone who is relied upon. 

If nothing else, that could be a a foundational part of your job security. 

I fear that keeping at this for too much longer will see me devolve into rambling, so I think I will conclude with this: although the *ability* to write programs and create apps is an important one&#8212;and, indeed, essential for showcasing one's talent and usefulness&#8212;it is ultimately not sustainable in the long-term. Specialization is increasingly important in our world of ever-evolving technologies.

The trick, then, is to pick something and stick to it.
