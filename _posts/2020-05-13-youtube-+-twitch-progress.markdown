For quite awhile now, I've thought it'd be wonderful to join the ranks of what many call *creators*, those guys and gals who have built the kind of internet presence that earns them a living. I've decided to focus my main efforts there on YouTube and Twitch, as I love the idea of sharing a few things I know and building a bit of a community.

Below is my current progress in becoming a money-making content creator, or at least meeting the minimum requirements to do so on my chosen platforms. Please hold all applause (or laughter) to the end.


## YouTube Partner

As of writing, watch time appears to be the most daunting requirement. It's supposed to be 4000 *hours* in the past year. I'm currently at almost 5:
<div style="border: 1px solid; border-color: transparent #ff0000 transparent transparent;">
  <div style="background-color: #ff0000; height: 24px; width: 0.12%;">
  </div>
</div>

Subscriptions are slightly less scary. I need at least 1000 and currently have 19:
<div style="border: 1px solid; border-color: transparent #ff0000 transparent transparent;">
  <div style="background-color: #ff0000; height: 24px; width: 1.9%;">
  </div>
</div>


## Twitch Affiliate

While perhaps not quite so lofty in requirements as YouTube's partner program, the path to Twitch Affilate requires *regular* time investment, which at present is hard to come by.

Of the required 500 minutes of streaming in the past 30 days, I've completed 87:
<div style="border: 1px solid; border-color: transparent #6441a5 transparent transparent;">
  <div style="background-color: #6441a5; height: 24px; width: 17.4%;">
  </div>
</div>

Though the above may seem like a bit much, this one might be toughest for me; of the required 7 unique broadcast days in the past 30, I have but 1:
<div style="border: 1px solid; border-color: transparent #6441a5 transparent transparent;">
  <div style="background-color: #6441a5; height: 24px; width: 14.28%;">
  </div>
</div>

I chalk this next one up to having but a single stream to my name, but I have 2 of the 3 required 30-day average concurrent viewers:
<div style="border: 1px solid; border-color: transparent #6441a5 transparent transparent;">
  <div style="background-color: #6441a5; height: 24px; width: 66.6%;">
  </div>
</div>

And finally, this also is likely due to the brevity of my stream thus far, but I have only 2 of the 50 required followers:
<div style="border: 1px solid; border-color: transparent #6441a5 transparent transparent;">
  <div style="background-color: #6441a5; height: 24px; width: 4%;">
  </div>
</div>

So as you can see, there is much to be desired here. However, tracking goals can be one of the best ways to help achieve them, so I'll be posting here periodically to update my new (and hopefully improved) status on all of these metrics. In the meantime, please consider [subscribing to my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/user/quiikwic73) or [following me on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/danielmoster), and I'll catch you next time!
